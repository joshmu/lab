### Purpose

This docs app serves as:
- A playground for testing documentation patterns
- A showcase for shared UI components from @repo/ui
- An example of multi-app Turborepo architecture

## Integration with Main Lab

This documentation app:
- Shares UI components with the main lab app via @repo/ui
- Uses the same TypeScript and ESLint configurations
- Runs alongside the main app in the Turborepo workspace
- Demonstrates component usage and patterns

## Monorepo Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start all apps
pnpm build        # Build all apps and packages
pnpm lint         # Lint all packages
