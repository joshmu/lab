# PRD: Filetree Explorer Layout for Josh Mu's Lab

**Project ID:** 20250726-172502  
**Created:** July 26, 2025  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** Product Team  
**Target Release:** Q3 2025  

## Overview

Josh Mu's experimental lab is a Turborepo monorepo showcasing modern web development patterns through interactive landing pages and experiments. Currently, the lab displays 6 hardcoded landing pages in a grid layout. As the lab grows with more experiments, projects, and diverse content types, there's a need for a more scalable and intuitive navigation system.

This PRD outlines the implementation of a filetree explorer layout that will provide a convenient way to add, organize, and navigate through an expanding collection of lab projects and experiments.

## Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
1. **Scalability Issue**: Landing pages are hardcoded in the main page component, making it difficult to add new experiments without code changes
2. **Navigation Limitations**: No hierarchical organization for different types of experiments (e.g., animations, data visualizations, prototypes)
3. **Discovery Challenge**: As experiments grow beyond 6 items, the grid layout becomes unwieldy and harder to navigate
4. **Content Management**: No systematic way to categorize, tag, or filter experiments based on technology, type, or complexity
5. **Development Friction**: Adding new experiments requires manual code updates rather than a file-based or data-driven approach

**User Need:**
Josh Mu needs an intuitive, expandable navigation system that allows him to quickly add new experiments, organize them logically, and provide visitors with an easy way to explore his growing collection of web development experiments.

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve Navigation Experience**: Create an intuitive filetree-style explorer that makes it easy to browse and discover experiments
2. **Enable Scalability**: Support unlimited experiments without performance degradation or UI clutter
3. **Reduce Development Friction**: Implement a system where new experiments can be added with minimal code changes
4. **Enhance Organization**: Provide hierarchical categorization and metadata support for experiments

### Success Metrics
- **Time to Add New Experiment**: Reduce from 15+ minutes (code changes) to <5 minutes (file-based)
- **Navigation Efficiency**: Users can find specific experiments 50% faster than current grid navigation
- **Content Scalability**: Support 50+ experiments without performance impact
- **Developer Experience**: 80% reduction in code changes needed for content updates

### Key Results (OKRs)
- **Q3 2025**: Launch filetree explorer with current 6 experiments migrated
- **Q4 2025**: Add 10+ new experiments using the new system
- **Q1 2026**: Implement advanced features (search, filtering, favorites)

   - *Mitigation*: Implement virtualization and lazy loading from start
   
2. **Breaking Changes**: Migration might break existing experiments
   - *Mitigation*: Gradual migration with backward compatibility

### Medium Risk
1. **Complex File Structure**: Nested categories might become unwieldy
   - *Mitigation*: Limit nesting levels and provide flattened views
   
2. **Search Performance**: Client-side search might be slow with many experiments
   - *Mitigation*: Implement efficient search libraries and consider server-side options

### Low Risk
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Modern features might not work in older browsers
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement and polyfills
   
2. **Mobile UX**: Complex navigation might not translate well to mobile
